Inspired by the battle-tested .NET [Polly library](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), Polly Dart brings enterprise-grade resilience patterns to the Dart ecosystem.\n\n## Why Resilience Matters More Than Ever\n\nIn our interconnected world, applications depend on numerous external services, APIs, databases, and resources. Network hiccups, service outages, and resource contention are not exceptionsâ€”they're inevitable realities. The question isn't whether your application will encounter failures, but how gracefully it will handle them.\n\nConsider these common scenarios:\n- A mobile app loses network connectivity while syncing data\n- A Flutter web app calls an API that's temporarily overwhelmed\n- A Dart server application hits database connection limits\n- A microservice times out due to unexpected load\n\nWithout proper resilience strategies, these situations lead to poor user experiences, data loss, and system instability.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## The Polly Dart Solution\n\nPolly Dart provides six core resilience strategies that can be combined to create robust, fault-tolerant applications:\n\n### ðŸ”„ Reactive Strategies\n- **Retry**: Automatically retry failed operations with intelligent backoff\n- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures by blocking calls to failing services  \n- **Fallback**: Provide alternative responses when operations fail\n- **Hedging**: Execute multiple parallel attempts for optimized response times\n\n### âš¡ Proactive Strategies\n- **Timeout**: Cancel operations that take too long\n- **Rate Limiter**: Control operation rate and manage concurrency\n\n## Design Principles\n\nWhen creating Polly Dart, I focused on several key principles:\n\n### 1. Developer Experience First\nResilience shouldn't require complex boilerplate code. Polly Dart uses a fluent builder pattern that makes creating resilience policies intuitive and readable:\n\n```dart\nfinal pipeline = ResiliencePipelineBuilder()\n    .addRetry(RetryStrategyOptions(maxRetryAttempts: 3))\n    .addCircuitBreaker(CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions(failureRatio: 0.5))\n    .addTimeout(Duration(seconds: 30))\n    .addFallback(FallbackStrategyOptions.withValue('Cached data'))\n    .build();\n\n// Clean, declarative resilience\nfinal result = await pipeline.execute(() => apiCall());\n```\n\n### 2. Composability and Flexibility\nStrategies can be combined in any order to create sophisticated resilience pipelines. Each strategy focuses on a specific concern, making the system both powerful and maintainable.\n\n### 3. Type Safety and Performance\nBuilt with Dart's strong type system, Polly Dart provides compile-time safety while maintaining excellent runtime performance. Strategies only activate when needed, keeping overhead minimal.\n\n### 4. Observability Built-In\nEvery strategy includes comprehensive callbacks for monitoring, logging, and metrics collection:\n\n```dart\n.addRetry(RetryStrategyOptions(\n  onRetry: (args) async {\n    logger.info('Retrying operation, attempt ${args.attemptNumber + 1}');\n    metrics.incrementCounter('retry_attempts');\n  },\n))\n```\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nLet me show you how Polly Dart transforms code from fragile to resilient:\n\n### Before: Fragile HTTP Client\n```dart\nclass ApiClient {\n  Future<User> getUser(int id) async {\n    final response = await httpClient.get('/users/$id');\n    return User.fromJson(response.data);\n    // What if the network fails? What if the server is slow?\n    // What if the service is temporarily down?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### After: Resilient HTTP Client\n```dart\nclass ResilientApiClient {\n  final _pipeline = ResiliencePipelineBuilder()\n      .addRetry(RetryStrategyOptions(\n        maxRetryAttempts: 3,\n        backoffType: DelayBackoffType.exponential,\n        shouldHandle: (outcome) => isTransientError(outcome),\n      ))\n      .addCircuitBreaker(CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions(\n        failureRatio: 0.5,\n        breakDuration: Duration(seconds: 30),\n      ))\n      .addTimeout(Duration(seconds: 15))\n      .addFallback(FallbackStrategyOptions(\n        fallbackAction: (args) => getCachedUser(id),\n      ))\n      .build();\n\n  Future<User> getUser(int id) async {\n    return await _pipeline.execute((context) async {\n      final response = await httpClient.get('/users/$id');\n      return User.fromJson(response.data);\n    });\n    // Now handles network failures, slow responses, service outages,\n    // and provides graceful fallbacks - all transparently!\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Platform Support\n\nPolly Dart works across the entire Dart ecosystem:\n\n- **Flutter Mobile** (iOS, Android)\n- **Flutter Web**\n- **Flutter Desktop** (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n- **Dart Server** applications\n- **Dart CLI** tools\n\nThe same resilience patterns work consistently across all platforms, making it easy to share code and expertise across your entire stack.\n\n## Learning from Production Experience\n\nThe patterns implemented in Polly Dart aren't theoreticalâ€”they're proven solutions that have helped organizations handle billions of requests reliably. The .NET Polly library has been battle-tested in production environments ranging from small startups to Fortune 500 companies.\n\nBy bringing these patterns to Dart, we're enabling the Flutter and Dart communities to build applications with the same level of resilience that enterprise systems depend on.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAdding resilience to your Dart application is straightforward:\n\n```bash\ndart pub add polly_dart\n```\n\nThen start with a simple retry policy and gradually add more strategies as needed:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:polly_dart/polly_dart.dart';\n\nfinal pipeline = ResiliencePipelineBuilder()\n    .addRetry()\n    .addTimeout(Duration(seconds: 30))\n    .build();\n\nfinal result = await pipeline.execute(() => yourOperation());\n```\n\n## What's Next\n\nThis initial release includes all six core resilience strategies with comprehensive configuration options. Future releases will focus on:\n\n- **Additional strategies** (bulkhead isolation, hedging variants)\n- **Performance optimizations** \n- **Enhanced monitoring** capabilities\n- **Integration guides** for popular Dart/Flutter packages\n- **Community feedback** and feature requests\n\n## Community and Contribution\n\nPolly Dart is open source and welcomes community contributions.
