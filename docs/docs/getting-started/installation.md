# Installation

Get Polly Dart up and running in your Dart or Flutter project in just a few steps.

## Requirements

- **Dart SDK**: 3.5.0 or higher
- **Flutter**: Compatible with all Flutter versions that support Dart 3.5.0+

## Adding Polly Dart to Your Project

### Using `dart pub add` (Recommended)

The easiest way to add Polly Dart to your project:

```bash
dart pub add polly_dart
```

For Flutter projects:
```bash
flutter pub add polly_dart
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, add Polly Dart manually to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  polly_dart: ^0.1.0
```

Then run:
```bash
dart pub get
# or for Flutter
flutter pub get
```

## Verify Installation

Create a simple test file to verify the installation:

```dart title="test_polly.dart"
import 'package:polly_dart/polly_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create a simple pipeline
  final pipeline = ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
      .addRetry(RetryStrategyOptions(maxRetryAttempts: 2))
      .build();
  
  // Test it works
  final result = await pipeline.execute((context) async {
    print('Executing operation...');
    return 'Hello, Polly Dart!';
  });
  
  print('Result: $result');
}
```

Run the test:
```bash
dart run test_polly.dart
```

You should see output like:
```
Executing operation...
Result: Hello, Polly Dart!
```

## Import Statement

After installation, import Polly Dart in your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:polly_dart/polly_dart.dart';
```

This single import gives you access to all the core classes:
- `ResiliencePipelineBuilder`
- `ResiliencePipeline`
- `ResilienceContext`
- `Outcome`
- All strategy options classes
